## WHAT IS POLKADOT? 🔍

[Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/utm_source=devpost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=hackathon%20north%20america&utm_content=technical%20resources) is a layer-0 protocol and multichain network founded by Dr. Gavin Wood, co-founder and former CTO of Ethereum. Polkadot provides security, scalability, and interoperability to a diverse network of layer-1 blockchains called parachains. Polkadot offers several advancements over legacy blockchain networks, from governance to customization, upgradeability, energy efficiency, and more. 🛡️⚡🔗

## WHAT IS KUSAMA? 🎨

Built on nearly the same codebase as Polkadot, [Kusama](https://kusama.network/utm_source=devpost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=hackathon%20north%20america&utm_content=technical%20resources) is a layer-0 protocol and multichain network. Kusama provides security, scalability, and interoperability to a diverse network of layer-1 blockchains called parachains, and serves as Polkadot’s ‘canary net’. Designed for radical innovation and experimentation, Kusama is used both as a live, value-bearing proving ground for Polkadot technology and as a deployment environment for early-stage startups and experimental blockchain use cases. 🚀🧪

## WHAT IS SUBSTRATE? 🛠️

[Substrate](https://www.substrate.io/utm_source=devpost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=hackathon%20north%20america&utm_content=technical%20resources) is a blockchain development framework for building and customizing parachains in the Polkadot ecosystem, as well as standalone or ‘solo’ chains. It features a completely generic state transition function and modular building blocks for common blockchain components like consensus, networking, and asset creation. By building with Substrate, development teams can significantly speed up production, reduce the cost of building a blockchain, and get much more power and flexibility than building on a smart contract platform. ⚙️🏗️

### Bifrost 🌉

[Bifrost](https://bifrost.finance/) is a Polkadot and Kusama parachain designed to provide liquidity for staked assets. It aims to enable users to hedge against the opportunity cost of staking on Polkadot and Kusama networks while maintaining liquidity of their staked assets. Bifrost is known for its derivative solutions, such as vTokens, which are designed to be versatile and can be used in multiple DeFi protocols.

#### Bifrost Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) 💧

Bifrost’s Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) are derivative tokens that represent staked assets on the Polkadot and Kusama networks. When users stake their DOT or KSM through Bifrost, they receive vDOT or vKSM respectively. These vTokens can be used across various decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms while still earning staking rewards. This mechanism allows users to unlock the liquidity of their staked assets without sacrificing the staking rewards, providing flexibility and enhancing the capital efficiency of their portfolios.

**Key Features of Bifrost LSTs:**
- **Liquidity:** Users can maintain liquidity of their staked assets, allowing them to participate in other DeFi activities.
- **Staking Rewards:** vTokens continue to accrue staking rewards, similar to the original staked assets.
- **DeFi Integration:** vTokens are compatible with various DeFi protocols, enabling users to maximize the utility of their staked assets.
- **Hedging:** Users can hedge against the price volatility of staked assets by leveraging the liquidity of vTokens.

#### Real-world Assets (RWAs) in Gaming 🎲

Ajuna is exploring the integration of Real-world Assets (RWAs) into its gaming ecosystem, allowing in-game assets to have real-world value and utility. By tokenizing physical assets or linking in-game items to RWAs, Ajuna enables players to own digital assets that are backed by real-world equivalents. This could include items like rare collectibles, property deeds, or even shares in real-world enterprises.

**Key Benefits of RWAs in Ajuna:**
- **True Ownership:** Players can own assets that have real-world value, enhancing the in-game experience and investment potential.
- **Liquidity:** Tokenized RWAs can be traded on decentralized marketplaces, providing liquidity to traditionally illiquid assets.
- **Cross-Game Interoperability:** RWAs can be used across multiple games within the Ajuna ecosystem, creating a more connected and valuable gaming experience.
- **Enhanced Engagement:** By linking in-game progress to real-world rewards, Ajuna increases player engagement and retention.

**RWA Use Cases in Ajuna:**
- **Tokenized Collectibles:** In-game items or characters that represent rare, real-world collectibles.
- **Property Deeds:** Virtual real estate that is linked to real-world property, providing both in-game utility and real-world value.
- **Real-World Backed Currency:** In-game currency that is backed by real-world assets, providing stability and real value to in-game economies.
